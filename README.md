# rusty-chip8
A chip8 emulator that I translated from my [C++ chip8 emulator](https://github.com/hosua/chip8) to rust.

Most things work well enough now, ~~they at least do work as well as they do on my C++ emulator.~~

Nevermind, Pong isn't working properly, and probably more games I haven't checked. 

Sound, and the sound timer is not yet implemented.

A bunch of games might not fully work either, but I believe most do.

Super chip-8 instructions are also not implemented, and I don't really plan on doing them.
